Notes

1. Concept and Scheme

At the start of a coding project the aims of the project should be scoped out, and a cheme for this should be created.

Consider this budgeting app. It needs to do the following:

	1. Provide a form for providing name and value of an income our outgoing.
	2. Include a field for choosing whether the value is an income or outgoing.
	3. Include an event handler to process the values when a button is clicked.
	4. Tablate each incoming
	5. Tablate each outgoing.
	6. Show total ingoings.
	7. Show totaloutgoings.
	8. Show current credit calculated from total income and outgoing.
	9. Include an indication of the % of total income that income represents.
	10. Indicate the % of total income that that outgoing represents.

With small tasks we may eb able to just bash out some code, but for a project we should identify our aims and the steps required to fulfil that aim before we start.

2. Modules

When planning a project it can help to break down the discrete tasks into modules.

Modules are basically distinct pieces of code that perform distinct functions.

	For example, in this budgeting app some functions process input data, calculating them into values. We could call this our Data Module.

	Other functions control the presentation of this data to the GUI. We could call these functions our UI Module.

	We also require an Event Handler for the data input. This could be called an Event Module, or Controller Module.

Over time you'll develop your own sense of useful module categories, and your own user-friendly module structures. But separating things like data and the UI is sensible and common.

So, how do we actually write modules?

IFFYs!

Modules are commonly written as IFFYs. This keeps them private, preventing variable contamination and allowing us to focus on them independantly.

It also keeps the code out of visibility to the user. It hides the implementation details.

The public part of the database is sometimes called an API.

This is called DATA ENCAPSULATION.
